                        INGREDIENTS AND SUBSTITUTES


Chicken - I always use thighs. Because I think it's more juicy and tender than breast meat. And yet, you can also use chicken breast of course. 
Tomato paste - I like using a little bit of tomato paste for the color and thickness it adds. But, you can also omit it.
Sour cream- I like sour cream in this, but if you prefer you can use yogurt instead.
Spice mix – Almost everyone has these common spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and paprika. They are found in most Indian or Middle Eastern dishes. And yet, if you don’t have these, you can substitute the powders in the recipe with 2 tbsp of curry powder.
Curry powder - Curry powder is readily available in most supermarkets these days. So, if you don't have the spices below don't worry too much, just add two heaping tablespoons of curry powder. Make sure you buy the curry powder that is right for you, not-spicy, medium or hot. I make my own so you can find my homemade curry powder as well as garam masala. So, if you like making your spice mixes, you will love to try these. 
you can add different things according to your wish.

    
                               PREPARE.

Clean, wash and chop the chicken.
Season with salt pepper and lemon juice - and set aside.
Add all the paste ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth.
COOK THE CURRY
Heat oil in a saute pan large enough for the whole recipe.
Add the ground paste and cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes.
If necessary, add a few tablespoons of water to prevent the spices from burning.
You will know the spices are cooked when you get a nice spice aroma in the house.
Next, add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir well.
Add the chicken pieces and coat well with the mixture.
Add one cup of water and stir.
Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes until the chicken is cooked.
Add sour cream and stir well.
Check and adjust seasoning.
Sprinkle with more chopped cilantro before you serve.
